        I’m a user experience engineer passionate about designing and building accessible, inclusive digital experiences that put people first. My favorite work lives at the intersection of empathy and execution by creating interfaces that are visually compelling and thoughtfully engineered for real-world impact, usability, and equity.

        I’m driven to create responsive, human-centered products that amplify underrepresented voices and make digital spaces more equitable. Whether I’m conducting user research, shaping thoughtful interaction flows, or building accessible interfaces, my goal is always the same: to design with empathy and develop with intention so that every experience is meaningful, inclusive, and rooted in real human needs.

        In the past, I’ve had the opportunity to work across a range of projects—from developing websites and designing user interfaces to conducting UX research and analyzing data to support inclusive design decisions.

        Outside of work, you can find me curating playlists, overthinking interface details, or enjoying a local matcha spot.
